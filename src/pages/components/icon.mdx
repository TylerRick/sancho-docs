# Icons

Sancho tries to find the right balance between ease, flexibility, and bundle size when it comes to including icons in your project. For that reason, Sancho
exports a recommended set set of [Feather icons](https://feathericons.com/) as React components. Importing
icons this way allows us to support treeshaking to ensure that only those icons that you use
in your project will be included in your final build.

### Basic usage

```.jsx
import { IconArrowRight } from 'sancho'

const Example = () => <IconArrowRight />
```

### Included icons

Here is a list of Sancho's exported icons.
